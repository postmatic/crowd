Comment moderation is a drag. Have your users lend a hand by flagging offensive comments and scrubbing your site clean.

== Description ==

Crowd Control gives your users the ability to report comments as inappropriate with a single click. If a comment gets flagged multiple times it'll be removed from the post and marked as pending moderation. We'll even send you an email to let you know. Now you can still go away on vacation and rest assured the trolls won't overrun your site.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin.
2. Copy the safe-report-comments directory into your plugins folder.
3. Visit your Plugins page and activate the plugin.
4. A new checkbox called "Allow comment flagging" will appear in the Settings->Discussion page.
5. Activate the flag and set the threshold value which will appear on the same page after activation. Set it to whatever you like.

== Screenshots ==

1. Simple settings on the Setings > Discussion screen.
2. A small report box is placed on your comment template allowing visitors to report a comment.
3. A new column is added to the comment moderation screen showing the number of times each comment has been reported. Comments which have been reported more than the allowed number of times (configured by you) are automatically sent to moderation.
